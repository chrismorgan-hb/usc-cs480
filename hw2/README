Files submitted:
----------------
camera.cc \ define a camera object
camera.h  / used for camera matricies

framebuffer.cc \ define a framebuffer object
framebuffer.h  / used to draw lines and write to file

globals.h - global definitions

light.cc \ define a light object
light.h  / used to store information about lights

Makefile - used to compile the project

matrix.cc \ define a matrix object
matrix.h  / supports multiplication by matricies and vectors

model.cc \ define a model object
model.h  / has points, faces, and transformations

polygonedge.cc \ define a polygonedge object
polygonedge.h  / used by scanline functions

renderer.cc \ define a renderer object
renderer.h  / ties all classes together to read file, render it, dump to output

rgbcolor.cc \ define an rgbcolor object
rgbcolor.h  / used to clean up code

stack.cc \ define a stack object
stack.h  / used to multiply points by the overall view matrix

utility.cc \ define utility functions
utility.h  / only used to determine which octant a line is in
 
vector.cc \ define a vector object
vector.h  / supports dot and cross product, as well as homogenize

shaded.cc - main file, takes command line args and calls renderer
*******************************************************************************

Compilation
-----------
command> gmake

see Makefile for complete details if you want
*******************************************************************************

Execution
---------
command> shaded <shadingType> <xRes> <yRes> <filename>

where 	<shadingType> is flat, gouraud, or phong
	<xRes> is the width of the viewing window
	<yRes> is the height of the viewing window
	<filename> is the OpenInventor file

When the program finishes, it will produce <image.ppm>
which must be viewed using irfanview on windows
xv will not display it
*******************************************************************************

Notes
-----
1) If an image has a camera position that is inside the model, an error
   will occur.  However, we were told that this would never happen by the
   professor.

2) Clipping/culling were not implemented per professor's instructions.  Models
   with lines extending outside of the window may result in errors.

3) I assume that vectors describing rotations around x, y, or z axis are unit
   vectors.  All other rotation vectors can be of any magnitude.

4) Rotation angles must be specified in degrees in the OpenInventor file.

5) Inline comments are available in the code, especially in confusing sections.
*******************************************************************************

Known Bugs
----------
1) Slight artifacts in all three shading types due to a rounding error
   somewhere in my algorithm.  If I manage to fix it, I will resubmit.

2) Same error results in problems with multiple lights using phong shading.
